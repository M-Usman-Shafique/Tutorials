AI: Branch of CS that focuses on developing such methods/algorithms that allow computers to learn without explicit programming.
Types of AI:
1. ANI
2. AGI

How to do AI?
ML: A subset of AI that enables models to learn and improve from data and previous experiences without explicitly programmed. Feeding data & letting the model generate rules on the basis of data (Generalization).

Classical AI: Feed algorithms (set of rules (if-else)) to AI. AI will receives input, apply rules and will give output.
ML: Train a model by giving data in the form of input-output pairs and ask it to generate rules by identifying certain patterns present in the data.

Model:

Types of ML:
A. Supervised Learning:
- Labeled Data:
1. Classification (input/output pairs: cat or cat not)
2. Regression: value/number i.e. stock, score predictions.

Model operates in two Modes:
1. Training Mode: Learning mode
2. Inference/Prediction Mode: Non-learning mode
Training Data: 70% data feeding
Testing/Validation Data: 30% to test
100% Accuracy: cram, over trained, over feeding & hard cored
Training Accuracy > Validation Accuracy = Bad Sign
Training Accuracy <= Validation Accuracy = Good Sign

B. Unsupervised:
1. Clustering: grouping similar things: A folder of 1M images of 3 types of animals
2. Anomaly Detection: Trained on normal things & when see abnormal give a warning instantly.
3. Dimensionality Reduction: 3D to 2D

C. Reinforcement Learning: bicycle riding
Agent: Learner
Reward & Punishment

D. Deep Learning: The study of Artificial Neural Networking.
Neural network of different functions returning output to a single place.
Exmp: Hiring a developer, Rishta.
GPT3 has 176B neurons.
